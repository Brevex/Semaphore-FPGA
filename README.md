<h2> &#128269; About the project </h2>

<p>A simple traffic light system based on a finite state machine synthesized in FPGA for the Altera DE2-70 board with Cyclone II. The system uses LEDs built into the board to simulate the traffic light states and uses the board's 7-segment display for the timer.</p><br>
